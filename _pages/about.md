I am a first year doctoral student in the [Faculty of Computer Science, TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik?set_language=en) under the supervision of [Prof. Jens Lehmann](https://jens-lehmann.org/) and [Prof. Ivo Sbalzarini](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/ivo-sbalzarini/group-leader). My active areas of research includes enhancement of factuality and reasoning in large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs. I have also investigated temporal understanding and reasoning in LLMs. 

Previously, I worked as an LLM Research Engineer at [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/de/institut/dresden.html) for training 7B decoder based models from scratch with A100 GPUs under the [OPENGPTx](https://opengpt-x.de/) project. 

I received my Master's from TU Dresden, Germany with major in Deep Learning and my Bachelor's from IIIT HP, India in Computer Science and Engineering. During the tenure of these degrees, I worked on a wide range of projects including machine learning, computer vision and tabular synthetic data generation.

I aim to work on projects that either push the boundaries of biology and medicine to improve lives or unlock new discoveries about the universe, ultimately making a lasting impact on humanity.
